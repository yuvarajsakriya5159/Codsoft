        Bhagat Singh was a prominent Indian freedom fighter and revolutionary who played a crucial role in the fight
        against British colonialism. Born on September 28, 1907, he is remembered for his acts of defiance, patriotism,
        and sacrifice during the Indian independence movement.

        He actively participated in various revolutionary activities such as the Central Legislative Assembly bombing in
        1929 and the Lahore Conspiracy Case. Bhagat Singh's martyrdom on March 23, 1931, continues to inspire and ignite
